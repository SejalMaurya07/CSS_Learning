    <p class="box1">HTML is the standard markup language for creating web pages.
        It provides the structure and content of a web page by using a system of tags and elements.
        HTML documents consist of a hierarchy of nested elements, forming a tree-like structure.
        Elements can include headings, paragraphs, images, links, lists, tables, forms, and more.
        HTML documents are interpreted by web browsers to display content to users.

        CSS: 
        CSS is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation of a document written in HTML.
        It enables web developers to control the layout, formatting, and appearance of multiple web pages 
        all at once.  CSS works by selecting HTML elements and applying styles to them, such as colors, fonts,
         spacing, and positioning.It allows for the separation of content (HTML) and presentation (CSS), 
         making it easier to maintain and update websites.CSS can be applied to HTML documents internally ,
          externally (using separate CSS files), or inline (directly within HTML tags).</p>
